Session 1: Introduction: Assignment 1
1. Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes? False
• Base R packages installed automatically? True
2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector? 
Recycling of elements in a vector means that when an arithmetic operation is tried on vectors of different size, instead of erroring out, it recycles or repeats the elements of the shorter vector to match that of the longer vector.
3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
A<- c( 1,2,3)
B<- c(10,20,30,40,50)
A+B
Answer will be 11,22,33,41,52 i.e. the elements of vector A will be repeated and added up until the length of vector A matches that of B.
